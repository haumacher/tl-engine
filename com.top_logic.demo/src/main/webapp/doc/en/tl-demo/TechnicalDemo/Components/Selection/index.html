<p>The view represents a demo for selection components in different configurations. To have data for the tests, they must be created in main tab<em>"Structures</em>".</p>
<p>The first selection is a multiple selection of a context (objects of type <code class="hljs inlineCode">A</code>). All children of the selected structure nodes are offered as options in the second selection<em>"Children</em>" (single selection). The object selected there will be displayed in the adjacent form.</p>
<p>The third selection<em>"Standard Multiple Selection</em>" also has as options all children of the context selection, but presets the selection with all objects of type <code class="hljs inlineCode">C</code> available for selection. Changing the selection has no further effect.</p>
<p>The selection<em>"Potential empty selection</em>" has the same options, but always preselects the elements which have a "<code class="hljs inlineCode">1</code>" in their name. Thus, in the standard setup (e.g. with context selection "<code class="hljs inlineCode">A2</code>"), an empty default selection can also be achieved.</p>
