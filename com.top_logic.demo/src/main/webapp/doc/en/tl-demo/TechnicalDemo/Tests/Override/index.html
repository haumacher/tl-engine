<p>Test case for overriding references with calculation rules. In the module <code class="hljs inlineCode">test.override</code> there is an abstract supertype <code class="hljs inlineCode">I</code>, which defines a reference <code class="hljs inlineCode">root</code>. This reference is overwritten with a calculation rule in each of the subtypes <code class="hljs inlineCode">A</code> and <code class="hljs inlineCode">R</code>. Only the subtype <code class="hljs inlineCode">S</code> inherits the reference unchanged and allows a value input at the user interface. The type <code class="hljs inlineCode">R</code> is also the target type of the tested reference <code class="hljs inlineCode">root</code>.</p> 
<p>In the "Table with Instances", instances of each of the three types can be created via a dialog with a generic form and a dialog with a form specialized for the type. After creation, the instances can be viewed in the two adjacent forms, each with generic forumuar and specialized form.</p> 
<p>When testing, it is important to note that a calculated override of the <code class="hljs inlineCode">root</code> reference cannot be edited. In the forms next to the table and in the table itself, the correct value of the calculation must be displayed.</p>
