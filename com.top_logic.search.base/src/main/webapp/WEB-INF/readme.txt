The structure of this directory is normally unchanged from this.
The Points of interest here are:

'multi-loader.properties':
Here we define the lookup order for the Multi loader.

TODO JHI,MGA some more explanation?

'web.xml':
If you use new Servlets and/or Taglibs in your project you have to add them here.
Also the the Display-name and appContext are set here.

Please change these two properties to the application name of your project.

TODO MGA is this neccessary ?
