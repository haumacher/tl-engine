<p>This view demonstrates the possibility of using drag &amp; drop to place objects on other objects and thus trigger a link operation, for example. In contrast to dropping "between" other objects, this usually does not modify the displayed structure, but creates a link from the object that was dragged to the dragged object.</p> 
<p>The example scenario is a list of work orders on the left and a structure of agents on the right. If you drag a work order to an agent, the work order is added to the agent's list of tasks. The work order disappears from the list of unprocessed tasks. The link is possible only if the agent has the "active" marker and the task type "A", "B", or "C" matches the agent. The types of tasks that an agent can process are defined when creating an agent.</p>
