<p>You are free to choose the attribute names. You can choose suitable names from the specialist domain. There is only one attribute with a special meaning.</p>

<h2>The name attribute</h2>

<p>If you create an attribute with the name <code class="hljs inlineCode">name</code> in a class, the value of this attribute is used, for example, to display a reference to this object in the user interface. Many specialist classes have a meaningful name attribute that can or must be filled directly by the user. If classes do not define a name attribute, then these must not be displayed directly in the user interface (e.g. as nodes in a <a class="tlObject" href="?page=Trees&amp;uuid=77e3e974-8b6a-4081-b58f-c0b3e51a91a5">tree</a>, or as values of <a class="tlObject" href="?page=References&amp;uuid=24f0521d-7151-428c-9619-cc92816b60be">references</a> of another class).</p>

<p>In more complicated situations, it may be indicated that the name attribute does not have to be filled directly by the user, but that the display name for an object is derived from several of its other attributes. In this case, a <a class="tlObject" href="?page=DerivedAttributes&amp;uuid=156bb8f1-02ff-4882-9e57-d2653554f4f8">calculated attribute</a> can also be used as a name attribute.</p>
