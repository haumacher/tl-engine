<p>The layout editor can be used to create new views in an application. A view displays a certain section of the application's domain model in a way that is optimized for the particular use case. The views of the application are structured in tabs or tiles. A tab or a tile can again contain</p>
<ul>
 <li>Tables</li>
 <li>Trees</li>
 <li>Forms</li>
 <li><a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=CreateChart&amp;uuid=7faa9f44-71ba-43c6-8739-e076cd4539e9">Diagrams</a></li>
 <li><a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=tiles&amp;uuid=d7be83f9-79c1-458a-aa2d-2611f0bf6686">Tiles</a></li>
 <li>or further <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=CreateTab&amp;uuid=8ab47cac-6622-4f05-983d-aeb48adccacb">tabs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>in any nesting depth.</p>
<h2>Design mode</h2>
<p>To create new views in an application, it must be switched to design mode. Only an administrator has this option to choose from. To make the views configured in this way accessible to other users, the layout must then be published.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><img src="ref:grafik.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>In design mode, tabs and views get new entries in their menus, which can be used to customize their configurations or add new tabs and tiles. The rest of this chapter deals with the layout configuration options.</p>
<h2>Publishing layouts</h2>
<p>After an administrator user has completed the layout configuration, the views configured in this way must be published so that other users can access them.</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><img src="ref:grafik_16244.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>After publishing the layouts, the design mode can be exited again to continue using the application in production mode. If other users are logged in during layout configuration, they will not see the changes to the application layout until they next log in to the application.</p>
<h2>Exporting layouts</h2>
<p>If an application is operated from a local development environment, the in-app configured layouts can be written back to the file system of the development environment as XML configuration via "Export Layouts" to be able to flow into a regular deployment process. For a server installation, this item is not available.</p>
