<p>This view demonstrates document attributes of objects that can be displayed and edited in a composition table in the context of another object.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the module <code class="hljs inlineCode">`test.webfolder`</code> defines a context type, which is shown here as a tile. This contains several subobjects, which in turn have a document attribute in addition to a name.</p>
