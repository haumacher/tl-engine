<h2>Label</h2>
<p>The label for the object in the requested language. The label is usually the name of the object. Uses the "Label Provider Service" to generate the label. That means in particular, <em>no automatic translation</em> is performed.</p>
<p>If no language is specified, the language in which the script is executed is used. If a language which is not supported is specified, the result is unspecified.</p>
