<p>Views in TopLogic allow you to navigate a dataset by linking the selection in a selection component to the model of a display component. Each component has at least one "model" channel through which it obtains its context object. A table, for example, uses the context model to calculate the rows displayed. A form, on the other hand, displays the attributes of the context model and allows you to edit them.</p> 
<p>In addition to its model channel, a table also has a selection channel that it uses to publish the row selected by a user. If you connect the selection channel of a table to the model channel of a form, you get a view in which the form always displays the details (all attributes) of the row object selected in the adjacent table, in addition to the table.</p>

<p>This connection can be multi-level. For example, a table can receive its context model from an adjacent tree and pass the selection to a form.</p> 
<p>In many cases, it is sufficient to connect component channels directly. However, if the receiving component is a form, for example, you may not want to directly display the object selected in an adjacent table, but rather the details of a property derived from it. In this case, a transformation must take place when forwarding the selection (for example, in a table) to a model (for example, a form).</p> 
<p>Such a model transformation can be performed in the model setting of, for example, a form component. With the setting "Transformation" the source component and its channel can be selected. In addition, a function can be configured which transforms the selected object obtained into the model object of the target component.</p>

<p>The view shown here demonstrates a transformation in a channel link by not displaying the selection in the table shown on the left directly in the adjacent form, but the object that is stored in the attribute "singelStructure" of the selected row object.</p>

<p>Another possibility is the <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=CombiningChannel&amp;uuid=ID_a9506dcf_efb8_4d19_81c8_a5e5b1a9e63e">channel combination</a> to combine the values from several component channels to one value.</p>
