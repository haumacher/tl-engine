<p>Normally expressions in TL-Script have no side effects. I.e. the evaluation of a TL-Script expression does not modify the application data. However, to be able to describe transactions, there are some operations whose evaluation modifies application data. These include creating, deleting, and modifying objects of the application. Such state-changing operations can be used only in specially marked places in the application configuration. Usually such configuration options are called "Operation".</p>
