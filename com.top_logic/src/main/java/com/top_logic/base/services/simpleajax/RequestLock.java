/**
 * Lock for synchronizing concurrent requests from a single browser instance.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This lock differentiates between readers and writers. A reader is an activity
 * that only observes the application state (e.g. generates a page). A writer is
 * an activity that modifies the application state. The lock ensures that only a
 * single writer activity is allowed to proceed. In contrast, multiple readers
 * may enter the lock concurrently and generate contents in parallel.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This lock may not be re-entered. No two calls to a {@link #enterReader(Object)} or
 * {@link #enterWriter(Integer)} method must happen in sequence without an
 * corresponding interleaving call to {@link #exitReader(Integer, Object)} or
 * {@link #exitWriter(Integer)}.
