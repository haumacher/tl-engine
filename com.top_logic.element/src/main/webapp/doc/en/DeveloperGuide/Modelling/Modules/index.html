<p>Modules (or packages) are a way of structuring large models. All types defined in a compartment model live in a module. TopLogic comes with a number of modules as standard. All additions that are defined in an application should be defined in one or more separate modules.</p>
<p>A new module is created in the module tree of the model editor.</p>

<p>The definition of a module includes at least one technical name. This module name becomes part of the name of all types defined in this module. The technical name should only consist of lower case letters and dots without spaces. In addition, the module can be given a display name, which is displayed instead of the technical name, e.g. in the module tree of the model editor.</p>

<p>The model editor always displays a class diagram for a module. This diagram contains the types defined in this module and all direct relationships that these types have to types from other modules. The diagram is empty immediately after creating a new module. It can then be filled with new types.</p>
