<p>The basic structure of a TopLogic data or business model is described using a UML class diagram. Such a model can be interpreted live in the application engine without code generation. For this purpose, the model is enriched using annotations. These annotations specify the storage of model elements in the database or describe the concrete representation of model elements in <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=LayoutEditor&amp;uuid=adeefc25-eac1-41e6-80d8-a685108be450">application views</a>.</p>
