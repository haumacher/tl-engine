<p>Binary data refers to all unstructured data such as documents, Word files, PowerPoint slides, text files that are managed with a TopLogic application. Binary data can be stored in attributes of the type "Binary" (<code class="hljs inlineCode">tl.core:Binary</code>). Such a binary value always consists of a name, a content type ( MIME type ) and the actual data stream. TL-Script provides support for handling and generating such binary values via a number of functions.</p>
