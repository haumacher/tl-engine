<p>Classes are the main types of a TopLogic subject model. A class describes the properties (represented in form fields or table columns) of an application object. There are concrete and abstract classes. A concrete class can be instantiated to an application object. An abstract class can only be used as a superordinate type for other classes.</p>
<p>A new class can be created in the diagram view of the model editor by clicking and placing the class template symbol.</p>

<p>A dialog then opens in which the properties of the class can be specified. At least one technical name must also be assigned to a class.</p>
<h2>Class name</h2>
<p>This name should consist exclusively of letters without spaces or special characters. The name should begin with a capital letter. If a combination of several words is to be used, it is advisable to start each of the sub-words with a capital letter for better readability. As a rule, it is good practice to use English for all technical names.</p>
<p>For example, a good name for a class that describes the properties of a robot would be <code class="hljs inlineCode">Robot</code>, or <code class="hljs inlineCode">RobotSystem</code>.</p>

<h2>Display name</h2>
<p>In addition to the technical name, a class also has a display name. Unlike the display name of modules, the display name of classes is also presented to the user of the application. For example, the type of an object is displayed in tool tips, or the user can choose between different types when creating an object.</p>
<p>If the display name of a class is not filled in, the English variant of the display name is derived from the technical name of the class. If you have configured a translation service and activated automatic translation for your user, the display name is also automatically translated into all other languages that are configured for the application.</p>
