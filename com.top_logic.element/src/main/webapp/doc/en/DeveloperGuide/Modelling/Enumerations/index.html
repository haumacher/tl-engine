<p>An enumeration type consists of a predefined list of instances, the so-called classifiers. These are defined directly when the model is defined and cannot be adapted or extended by the user of the application. From the user's perspective, an enumeration type looks like a normal class type when selected in a reference. The user can select from a predefined set. In the case of the enumeration type, this selection set is determined by the classifiers defined in the model; in the case of a normal class type, it is determined by the instances of the class.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>An enumeration type should only be used if it is foreseeable that function expressions will refer to individual classifiers of the type. Typically, this occurs in case distinctions based on status attributes: "If the project status is 'in progress', then the plan values can no longer be edited".</p>

<p>In this case, it could be useful to introduce an enumeration type <code class="hljs inlineCode">ProjectState</code> with the classifiers as shown above. The advantage of such an enumeration is that the individual classifiers have names in the model that can be used to access them directly in function expressions. Cf. <a class="tlObject" data-custom="false" href="?page=ModelLiterals&amp;uuid=b0c8b841-dcb8-4457-99d9-270eec27a9f9">model literals</a>.</p>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>When using enumeration types in a model, you should bear in mind that they are not as flexible as normal classes and their instances. For example, no further properties can be defined for an enumeration type. The instances of an enumeration type (the classifiers) have exactly one technical name and one internationalized display name. All these properties of classifiers are unchangeable according to their definition. The list of classifiers of an enumeration type can still be adapted at application runtime. However, the definition of a new classifier is an administrative process. An enumeration type may therefore not be used if the creation or deletion of classifiers is a user task.</p>
<h2>Alternative</h2>
<p>Instead of an enumeration type, a simple class with an internationalized name attribute can be used. This type of modeling has the advantage that it can be supplemented with additional properties. A separate view can easily be created for the administration of the instances of such a type, e.g. via a <a class="tlObject" data-custom="false" href="?page=GridComponent&amp;uuid=cac83987-104b-4154-821c-7c3e623041c8">grid</a>. The only disadvantage of such an alternative is that an instance of such a type cannot be referred to directly in a function expression. This alternative should therefore only be selected if no function logic is attached to the individual instances of the enumeration.</p>
