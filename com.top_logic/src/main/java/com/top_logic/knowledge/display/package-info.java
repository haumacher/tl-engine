/**

 * Classes to display Objects found in {@link com.top_logic.knowledge.service.KnowledgeBase}s as
 * HTML. The system should be able to display any kind of information found in the knowledge base.
 * Therefore we provide this package, which can be extended by developers themselves.

 * <p>
 * The concept of this package is outdated. It is based on JSP-Pages and Servlets only. As of this
 * writing you should use {@link com.top_logic.mig.html.layout.LayoutComponent}s that provide a more
 * sophisticated Model/View/Controle concept
