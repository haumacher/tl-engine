<p>The help editor allows you to create and edit help pages of views. The view is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>On the left side there is a tree that represents the different help pages:</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_8.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>In the toolbar it is possible to switch between the different languages supported for the help. In the menu</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>there are numerous import and export functions. It is possible to create additional (sub)pages for the selected help page by specifying a title. The action</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_9.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>checks the consistency of the help pages: Check for duplicates, validity of links, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to mark views during application development so that help pages can be created for them. For example, in the configuration of a tab</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_4.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>there is the possibility to set <code class="hljs inlineCode">Enable help</code>. If this configuration option is set, then in the menu of the help editor the action</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_1.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>in the Help Editor menu will generate a help page for the tab. With the command</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_3.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>the selected help page including all subpages would be translated. If you want to translate e.g. German pages into English, you have to switch to the target language first. In the toolbar of the table of contents there is a field to select this language.</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_2.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>Then the pages can be translated by specifying a language from which the pages should be translated automatically.</p>
<p>On the right side a WYSIWYG editor offers the possibility to easily edit the selected help page.</p>
<p>In the menu of the toolbar</p>
<p><img src="ref:grafik_5.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p>you can validate the individual help page separately, i.e. test the validity of the links and have them translated. In addition, it is possible to display the view for which this help page provides the documentation or to compare it with old revisions of the help page using the <code class="hljs inlineCode">Compare...</code> action.</p>
