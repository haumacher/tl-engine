<p>This view demonstrates a type with various selection attributes. In particular, selections are defined here for the primitive types integer, floating point number, and string. The available selection options all depend on the "Min" and "Max" values of the base object. If the input for "Min" and "Max" changes, the available selection options must also change. A special feature is the attribute "Best Value". Its selection options depend on the selections for "Value" of the part objects in the "Parts" composition attribute.</p> 
<p>New objects can be created either in the grid via "New Row" or in a "New Object..." dialog. The view shows the selection attributes in all editing contexts (grid, form, creation dialog).</p>
