<p>The view displays the demo data in a simple table.</p> 
<p>The configuration of a table is largely divided into three areas.</p> 
<p>Through</p> 
<p><img src="ref:grafik_3.png" style="opacity:1"></p> 
<p>you can configure the component model of the table. For example, the table can be connected to other components via a channel.</p> 
<p>Additionally you can configure the supported types of the table and the columns that should be displayed in the table by default. The ID column specifies by which column the table is initially sorted.</p>

<p>Here, similar to <a class="tlObject" data-custom="false" href="?page=Baum&amp;uuid=ID_c53aacd0_bb85_4056_b8aa_c1e7fd4a8c1e">Tree</a>, the component model is ignored. All elements of the type <code class="hljs inlineCode">DemoTypes.All</code> are displayed in the table. The&nbsp; component model and checker configuration is particularly important in order to decide, if an object was created in another view, whether this object is also automatically added or displayed in this table.</p>
