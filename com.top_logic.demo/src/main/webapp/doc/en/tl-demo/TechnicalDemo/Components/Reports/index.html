<p>The view demonstrates the use of HTML templates and HTML reports. An HTML template consists of structured text with embedded script expressions. In a report, these expressions are automatically evaluated in view mode with the base model in the variable <code class="hljs inlineCode">$model</code> and the result is displayed in the document.</p> 
<p>In this example, you can administer an HTML template in the context of an organizational unit. All contracts created in the context of this organizational unit will receive the template of the organizational unit as default value for their report. The finished report is displayed in the "Print view" tab.</p>
