<p>Top-Logic Script (TL-Script) is a functional language for describing (search) expressions with direct reference to the application model.</p>
<p>TL-Script has a syntax reduced to a minimum, consisting essentially of function definition and application (see <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=Functions&amp;uuid=8f4a805f-125a-4905-8df3-65aa54e20947">functions)</a>. This makes TL-Script extremely easy to learn, even for beginners.</p>
<p>Because of its functional nature, TL-Script does not require programs to be created from commands, branches, and loops; instead, a TL-Script is simply the evaluation of a calculation rule used to compute a result from one or more input values. A TL-Script expression is therefore more like a formula in a spreadsheet cell than a program. Therefore, TL-Script does not require any prior knowledge of a "real" programming language such as C, Java or JavaScript.</p>
<p>Due to a large number of predefined functions, many calculations can be formulated extremely short.</p>
<p>Although TL-Script mainly consists of formula evaluation, there is an extension for describing application transactions. These special scripts that change the state of the application can only be used in a few places in the application configuration where operations (instead of just calculations) are needed, see <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=Transactions&amp;uuid=c965c93c-6140-4f81-93ec-85bc9f5610e4">transactions</a>.</p>
