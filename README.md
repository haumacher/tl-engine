# TopLogic - the automated application engine

This is the home of the open-source version of _TopLogic - the automated application engine_. TopLogic is the only 
open-source model-based no-code web-application development platform. With TopLogic, you are able to create professional
three-tier web-applications using diagram-based modeling (UML and BPMN) in combination with WYSIWYG user-interface 
configuration. 

However, your scope is not limited to the no-code approach. Due to the openness of TopLogic, the engine can be 
customized to your needs and extended with plug-ins at all levels, starting from new UI components, custom services and 
interfaces, custom scripting capabilities and even custom model elements and types.  

TopLogic is provided to you by [Business Operation Systems GmbH](https://top-logic.com/ueber-uns/).

## Getting started

TopLogic features so called in-app development. This means that most of the development tools are built-in. 
Start creating a new app therefore is a three step process:

1. Install the engine and log in.
2. Draw and configure your models, processes and user interfaces.
3. Start using your new app.

However, you are not limited to in-app development. When using TopLogic with a team of developers, you can still use 
standard development workflows with repositories, version control, build and deployment process(es).

## Getting in touch

The TopLogic team offers a Discord server ([join](https://discord.gg/XsNq9JXTe9)) with several channels where you can 
join and watch the development of TopLogic. Having questions about TopLogic, the installation, configuration, and usage, 
this is the right place to visit.
