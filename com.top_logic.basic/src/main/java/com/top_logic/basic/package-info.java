 * Several general utility classes.

 * These classes should be usable standalone, or in small, simple Calls hierarchies. Features should

 * <p>
 * The most widely used classes are <code>Logger</code> and <code>XMLProperties</code>. Some classes
 * are not used at all and may be removed in later revisions.
