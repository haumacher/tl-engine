<p>The channel combination is a special form of channel transformation<a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=TransformingChannel&amp;uuid=ID_2817fb4d_154c_4c66_b59b_de9f30e0da81">with</a> several input channels. The view shown here displays the table of all Demo A objects which have two specific classification elements in their attributes "checklistMulti" and "checklistSingle". This filtering is not realized by a user-defined table filter, but by two explicit selection components preceding the table.</p>

<p>The components shown here are connected in such a way that the target table determines its context model as a "value combination" of the selection channels of the two selection components.</p> 
<p><img src="ref:image_1.png" style="height:480px; opacity:1; width:600px"></p> 
<p>This value combination causes the context object of the table to be a two-element list that contains the object selected in the left selector at position 0 and the object selected in the right selector at position 1.</p> 
<p>This value combination is used in the function that calculates the row objects for a double filtering of the demo A objects according to the two criteria.</p>
