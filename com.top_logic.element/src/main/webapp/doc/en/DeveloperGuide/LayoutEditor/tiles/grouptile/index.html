<p>In a tile group, just as with <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=CreateTab&amp;uuid=8ab47cac-6622-4f05-983d-aeb48adccacb">tabs</a>, several components are configured and displayed. Unlike tabs, these components are displayed as tiles.</p>
<p>There are several types of tiles that can be added to a tile group:</p>
<p><img src="ref:image_72395.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p><img src="ref:image_5160.png" style="opacity:1"></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Standard Tile</h2>
<p>Any components can be configured in a standard tile.</p>
<h2>Predefined tiles</h2>
<p>There are some tiles where the preview of the tile and the component displayed is predefined.</p>
<h3>Chart JS Tile</h3>
<p>Here, an evaluation can be made using a model. This evaluation is displayed in the tile and in the preview for this tile.</p>
<h3>Document tile</h3>
<p>In the document tile a PDF document is displayed. Which document is to be displayed is specified via a <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=TL-Script&amp;uuid=d1172c3d-4596-48b0-837a-42349d1e3227">TL-Script</a> expression. The document is also displayed in the tile preview.</p>
<h3>Object Tiling</h3>
<p>Here an alternative display for a set of subject objects is configured. The subject objects that are displayed are specified using a <a class="tlObject" data-custom="true" href="?page=TL-Script&amp;uuid=d1172c3d-4596-48b0-837a-42349d1e3227">TL-Script</a> expression. For each of these objects a separate tile is displayed. By clicking on a tile, this object can be used as a context model for another component.</p>
