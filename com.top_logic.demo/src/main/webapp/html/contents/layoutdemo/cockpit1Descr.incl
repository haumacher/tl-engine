<p>
The three Windows you can see here are in a special Container, a <i>CockpitLayout</i>.
</p>
<p>
In a <i>CockpitLayout</i> you can display any kind of <i>LayoutComponent</i>s but for 
windows you can do some aditional things. A <i>WindowLayout</i> can be marked as maximiseable.
If so a aditional icon is rendered in the windowbar allowing to size up the window to the size 
of the <i>CockpitLayout</i>.
