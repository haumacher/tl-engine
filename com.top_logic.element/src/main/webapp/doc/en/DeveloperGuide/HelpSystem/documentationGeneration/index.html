<h2>Generating documentation from the application structure</h2>
<p>For a newly created application, it is important to provide the user with documentation on which views can be used for which purpose.</p>
<p>For this purpose the command <code class="hljs inlineCode">Generate documentation</code> can be used in the view <code class="hljs inlineCode">Administration &gt; Development &gt; Help editor</code>.</p>
<p>This command generates documentation templates below the selected page based on the application structure. For each view in which a help ID is set, a page is created. If necessary, parent pages are created to mimic the tab and dialog structure of the application.</p>
<p>This command can be executed multiple times; pages are only created for views that do not yet exist. Pages that have already been created are not changed.</p>
